## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Got up to speed with new software and development tools.  Refamiliarized myself with the code structure and format.  

## This Week's Plan

> Design and hopefully implement a function/method/class to label inputs and outputs of FF/Decoders/Encoders/MUXes. I completed the same task last semester, however the project began a major refactor at the end of last semester.  This means I am going to have to rewrite and reformat my previous work to fit the new environment. This also means I will have to write code to accomodate components which have yet to be added.  I will spend more time than before designing it properly and cleanly before implementation begins.  


## Anything Blocking?

> I have to become familiar with the methods and new structure of the code.  I also have to become accustomed with the typescript syntax as opposed to the javascript syntax.
