## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week I have fixed the component input port rendering issue.  
Most of the time was spent trying to find the piece of code that controlled the rendering.
After finding the method, I experimented with different ways to improve how it appears, and different ways to implement that change.
 

## This Week's Plan

> This week's plan is to consult with the project lead to determine what I should do next.  
There has been talks of expanding the platform to include, not just logic or digital circuits, but also analog circuits.
With my background in computer engineering, I will be a part of the subgroup to handle this addition. 
So, I have to see whether the lead will want me to continue to implement the label switch (which was the plan last week), or switch to the analog circuit compartment.
Should I switch, I will most likely begin by working with the other subgroup members to design how we will implement the analog circuit simulator.
The design will be important, so it will most likely take the week to manage.

## Anything Blocking?

> The biggest blocker for the design of the analog project would be my lack of knowledge on how to create project from the ground up.
I understand or can learn quickly how to use each of the tools or software.
However, I do not know how to choose which tools/software to use, or how to have them work together and mesh to create a cohesive product.
