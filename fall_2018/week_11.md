## Last Week's Accomplishments

> The request has been accepted and is awaiting deployment. I have been integrated into the refactoring team, but have been unable to 
accomplish much so far due to IED and other class assignments.

## This Week's Plan

> Work on refactoring the labels for flip flops by bringing the label code into the parent class, instead of having a large method in each 
component.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am still getting used to object-oriented programming and inheritance, so I anticipate a lot of experimentation.  Outside of my knowledge
base, all deadlines for all of my courses are this coming week, which leaves very little time to refactor.
