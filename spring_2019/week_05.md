## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week I discussed the project with the project leader and we have 
agreed to create a GitHub repository for the electrical engineering 
portion of the OpenCircuits project.  For now, the working title will be 
EE OpenCircuits or something to that effect.  We have also determined that, 
practically, the EE portion will be given a subdomain of the OpenCircuits 
website, but will be its own application for the most part. In terms of
implementation, Hari and I are currently the only two members working on the EE
project.  We have begun designing the algorithms, and we have a basic
algorithm set up, but we are trying to make it more efficient as it is currently
O(n^3), roughly. We have also decided to model it after the appearance and 
functionality of PSpice, because it is what most EE's are familiar with, but
also ensure they are separate from one another to protect against legal issues.

## This Week's Plan

> This week's plan is to finalize a suitable algorithm.  If we (Hari and I) 
cannot come up with one that is efficient enough, we may contact some 
professors for assistance.  In terms of actual code, we will most likely 
maintain the same stack as OpenCircuits proper, in order to allow for easier 
crossover between projects and a more cohesive final product. If time allows, we
will also begin writing test cases and implementing simple circuits in order to
lay the foundation of the rest of the project.

## Anything Blocking?

>  The largest hurdle is the algorithm.  Automating circuit simulation and 
circuit analysis is a task I have never encountered and I do not believe anyone
else in the group has either. I have a few ideas, but if worse comes to worse, 
we do have a workable algorithm to use so that we can focus on the actual
construction of the application.
