## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This last week I have been assigned to the subgroup working on the low-level circuit simulation.
Design has begun, but we have not solidified who will be in the group, so nothing can be finalized yet.
I have also refactored some of the code from my recent additions to make it more legible and clean.
I pulled out some repeated code segments and put it into its own method, among some other simple minor changes.

## This Week's Plan

> This week's plan is to consult with the project lead and determine how he wants this application to work with/alongside the existing project
Also, I will continue to design the framework and algorithms needed for this simulation to function.
These algorithms include those about computer efficiency, to ensure there is no lag and the project performs well,
and electrical engineering algorithms, to determine the values of resistance, voltage, current, etc.

## Anything Blocking?

> At this point, the only thing really blocking is time management.
Juggling Operating Systems, Intro to Electronics, Open Source Software, and Engineering Probability along with RCOS is quite the challenge.
Hopefully, spring break will give me some time to get ahead of my work... hopefully.
Wish me luck!
