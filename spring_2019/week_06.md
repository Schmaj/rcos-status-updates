## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week we have developed our algorithm sufficiently to be used in the application.
We have also created the repo in order to building the project.
We have begun writing test cases for the different components as a base for the rest of the project.

## This Week's Plan

> This week's plan is to finish the creation of the basic tests, and begin implementing some more 
aspects of the site.
We will also most likely modify the analysis algorithm in order to take advantage of a graphing
algorithm used in the original OpenCircuits project.

## Anything Blocking?

>  There is currently nothing blocking development yet.  At least nothing foreseen.
