## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week we finished the basic tests and components, and have begun adding more components.
We have also narrowed down the algorithm to either current loop/mesh analysis or nodal analysis.
Nodal analysis can be better adapted for the graphing algorithm, so we will most likely go with that.

## This Week's Plan

> This week's plan is to finalize the algorithm and begin implementing it.
This will be a significant step to creating a working sister application to OpenCircuits proper.
We will also add the final basic components for the first version of the site.
Once that is finished, we will work on the UI and the hopefully get a working
demo by the time of the presentation.

## Anything Blocking?

>  There is currently nothing blocking development yet.  At least nothing foreseen.
