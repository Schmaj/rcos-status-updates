## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Labels have been added to the newly added components: Flip Flops. This was done in the same fashion as the labels for Latches. 
I refactored the code as much as I could.  I submitted a pull request, which is currently pending.

## This Week's Plan

> Get the pull request accepted, and find a new project section to work on.  I believe the only thing holding back the pull request is
the review, and that the code is functional and will integrate cleanly.

## Anything Blocking?

> I have to find an issue or feature that I can complete and is not too difficult for my level of understanding.

## Notes

How long before winter break?
