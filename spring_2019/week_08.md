## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We have finished the basic tests, however progress has been slower than anticipated.
Implementation of the algorithm has been tricky, since I have never used the graphing tools
from the OpenCircuits project.
I have been working with Leon, the project lead, in order to better understand the tools, and 
to better design the sub-project.
Implementation will hopefully be done by the final presentation in a few weeks.
The basic components have been added.
However, UI may present a challenge because no one currently on this sub-project
have experience with that aspect of application development. 

## This Week's Plan

> This week's plan is to finally implement the analysis algorithm.
We have also gained a new contributor for the project, so we will be
able to get more done.  We plan on adding more components this week,
like a node component, which will aid in the analysis.
We will also begin prepping for the final presentaion this week,
such as planning what to show and talk about.

## Anything Blocking?

>  There is currently nothing blocking development yet.  At least nothing foreseen.
