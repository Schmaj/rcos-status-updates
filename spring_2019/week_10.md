## Last Week's Accomplishments

> We implemented a basic demo, however it will not be used in the presentation. 
It will be used as proof of concept and initial testing for new components later on.
I will be presenting with the OpenCircuits group in about an hour, and I believe I
have prepared enough. Wish me luck!

## This Week's Plan

> This week's plan is to ace the presentation and find some other aspect of the EE project
to work on next week.

## Anything Blocking?

>  There is currently nothing blocking development yet.  At least nothing foreseen.
