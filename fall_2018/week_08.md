## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Labels have been added to all components except gates.  Gates will not be labelled because labels would be unnecessary. 
MUXs and DEMUXs posed a larger challenge because their shape was not the common square.  Instead, the top and bottom were sloped.  
Therefore, the shape had to be modified to keep the labels from overlapping. The labels for the selection lines (bottom) also had to be 
shifted to keep a semi-constant cushion with the edge.

## This Week's Plan

> REFACTOR! The rough code was adapted from another component, then augmented to fit the labelled component. Because of this, 
much of the code is similar.  To clean this up, I plan on bringing the common aspects of the code to the super class, in this case the
Gate class, and commenting for future readability.

## Anything Blocking?

> I believe my understanding of JavaScript classes/subclasses is sound, but I'm going to find out.

## Notes

Why does Signals & Systems suck?
